    "## Understanding scaling of linear algebra operations on Apache Spark using Apache SystemML\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment we want you to understand how to scale linear algebra operations from a single machine to multiple machines, memory and CPU cores using Apache SystemML. Therefore we want you to understand how to migrate from a numpy program to a SystemML DML program. We won't need this knowledge anyways if we are sticking to Keras only, but once we go beyond that point we'll be happy to see what's going on behind the scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the first thing we need to ensure is that we are on the latest version of SystemML, which is 1.2.0:"
